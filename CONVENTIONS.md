- Strive to choose good design patterns and follow best practices for any framework in use, such as Vue.
- Aim to make small changes at the time. Don't edit more than one component at the time if possible, per commit.
- The application should be able to be built into static files that can be hosted on platforms like GitHub Pages.
- The web app should be mobile friendly.
- Always follow UX and UU conventions when editing the web app.
- For Vue Pages, use the following structure:
  - 1) HTML, 2) CSS, 3) JavaScript/Typescript.
  - Use a three line banner/separator between each section.
