Create the skeleton for a web app. Use Vue. Requirements:
- Client side only. Dont use NPM.
- I should consist of these views:
    - A page called "Player entries"
    - A page called "Tournament"
    - A page called "Match"
    - Just add a title to these pages, no content.
  - Follow best practices for Vue. Put related functionality inside Vue components, that is, javascript, HTML and CSS. Don't create code where you put all at once - that is not how good Vue code looks like.
